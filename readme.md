## Documentation
# 
#  How it works:
 - The chatbot takes predefined queries and returns financial insights from our dataset.
 - It uses if-else conditions to match user input to stored responses.
 
# Predefined queries it supports:
 - "What is the total revenue for Apple?"
 - "How has net income changed for Tesla over the last year?"
 - "What is the cash flow growth for Microsoft?"
 - "Compare revenue growth between Apple and Microsoft."
 
#  Limitations:
 - Only responds to predefined queries.
 - Does not process user-generated queries dynamically.
 - No integration with live financial data sources (e.g., SEC filings).
